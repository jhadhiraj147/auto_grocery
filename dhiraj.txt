add the robots to offload the trucks logic 


a redis should be add for the ordering, currentlhy the mapping is sku - quanity for purchase but 
the user may say apple 10 qty instead apple123-344 10 qty, redis will hold the mapping common names and skus!




add a go routine to be run in the ordering service,,, it will run every minute to ensure
pending stocks are cleared off. 

or 

can we do one thing, when the user clicks preview, 
it only holds the item for 30 seconds and then 
if they quit the tab or does not confirm nor cancels, 
it will automatically cancel after 30 seconds  



security feature for truck! may be admin panel! 

later changing passwords for users features 


use redis for caching the timer data, it has this subscriber thing called 
keyspace notification! if our inventory is subscribed to that port, it will notify it
that this pending order is expired, and then our background worker can simply execute
cancel order on the order id.. instead of creating a worker that scans through our orders 
continuosly 



currently the db of pricing microservice syncs with the db of inventory service 
every one hour, we need to use webhooks or may be add a grpc method in the inventory service 
that will notify the pricing microservice that the inventory db has been changed so they will run this
sync db function! that will reduce load
